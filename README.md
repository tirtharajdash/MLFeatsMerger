# MLFeatsMerger
Merging two feature files based on matching first column

*This is for my personal usage only. If you think, it is useful for you, you can use it with little modification.

This bash file takes three 4 files (3 features + 1 target) file and generates a perfect ML dataset. For more information, look at the example. This example won't work for you (for sure). This bash script also does some serious amount of preprocessing before making the files concatenata-ble.

If you are a Unix (Shell) scripting guy, you should be able to figure out easily what is this file doing.
